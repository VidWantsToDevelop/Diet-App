**Distinctiveness and Complexity**:
First of all, I would like to say that, in this project, I have used some of the new features. Here are the some of the: 
a)Chart.js: Quite interesting JavaScript library which allowed me to implement any kinds of charts and graph into my project.
b)Responsive design: That was  a really interesting experience of setting up a css file for different kinds of screens, that made my project more flexible and reliable.
c)And my favourite one - Bootstrap: This framework made my life much easier, with the help of bootstrap I have established a lot of elements, for example: footer, navbar (which can even collapse, if you use it on the mobile phones)
d)Also, I would like to mention - the usage of animations. Animations made my project look much smoothier and easy on the eye.
e)This project contains a lot of JavaScript functions, that helped my project to look more dynamic (especially the usage of promises, which made it easier to work with the requests from the Fetch API). With the help of splitted fucntion it was much easier to save some space and use animation with any element I would like to.
